# Project Name:
Lotus

# Introduction: 
Lotus is a unique store dedicated to selling handmade crafts from Upper Egypt. Our mission is to expand our marketing efforts to provide a steady income for the talented artisans behind these beautiful creations. By promoting their work, we aim to preserve traditional craftsmanship and support local communities.

Our project created for artisans from Upper Egypt and be the gate to the market.

# Inspiration:
Our project is inspired by the rich and unique culture of Upper Egypt. These artisans create beautiful handicrafts that often don't reach a broader audience.
I’ve lived in Upper Egypt and witnessed firsthand the incredible craftsmanship that goes unnoticed. This inspired us to create a platform that connects these artisans with a wider audience, helping them showcase and sell their work.
We wanted to bridge the gap between the creators and those who appreciate and value such unique pieces of art. This project is not just about commerce, but also about preserving and promoting cultural heritage.
